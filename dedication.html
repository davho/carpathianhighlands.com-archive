<H2 CLASS="western">This Page is dedicated to the memory of my
parents, FRED DRAN (1900-1972) and MARY SIRAK DRAN (1913-1975) who
were children of immigrants, and to all of the relatives that came
before and after them.  It is also dedicated to the inhabitants of
the Carpathian Highland villages of my ancestry,

<H2 CLASS="western"><FONT COLOR="#993300">SWIATKOWA WIELKA</FONT> and
<FONT COLOR="#993300">DUDYNCE</FONT>, both located in the crownland
of Galicia in the Austro-Hungarian Empire from  1772-1918 after which
they became a part of Poland , as well as the village of <FONT COLOR="#993300">HRABOVCIK</FONT>
on the southern slopes of the Carpathian Mountains, which also was
part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, but the part that was
administered by Hungary, later being incorporated into Czechoslovakia
and still later Slovakia.

<H2 CLASS="western">My ancestors were peasants with small land
holdings and had a self-sufficient lifestyle dependent on the land.
In May 2002 I first traveled to my ancestral villages, now located in
southern Poland and eastern Slovakia.  Somewhere in my mind I
envisioned an idyllic life of the past and anticipated visiting and
entering a &ldquo;time warp&rdquo; of village life.  Time changes
things and so do war and politics. I found a few of the typical log
cabin homes, but in most cases homes had been destroyed and rebuilt
after WWII. In two of the villages, Greek Catholic residents had been
deported in 1947. Houses were abandoned, decayed or scavenged,
leaving only an empty space.  Like shrines, springtime apple trees
bloom and bear witness to the past souls who once lived there on the
still beautiful but sparsely settled rolling landscape of the
Carpathian Mountains.
