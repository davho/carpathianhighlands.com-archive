Theresa Osiurak Teoli contributed the following article.   Her
mother, Magdalena Furdak Osiurak, survived Hitler and immigrated to
the USA.  This article, published in 1947 in a Ukrainian newspaper,
was kept with her valuables as a reminder.  After Magdalena&rsquo;s
death, her daughter, Theresa, had the article translated into English
because she knew of its importance to her mother. With her permission
we have included it here. The atrocities described took place along
the San River centered in the town of Bukowsko which is a short

resettlement of Poles from the (Ukrainian) Western lands to Poland
started in the fall of 1945 and was accomplished quickly and without
much interference.  It would appear that the Poles did not feel
indigenous to these lands.  In addition to this, they felt that they
could gain by settling on the &gt;regained lands&lt;, lands from
which the Germans were banished.  The Poles were resettling en mass,
thus for example many Poles from Lviv headed for Breslau.  But even
here, the communists did not press the issue as 30,000 Poles were
allowed to remain in Lviv (mostly older people, the infirm and single
women.)</B></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

Ukrainians was totally different.  Our population felt indigenous to
the lands where they lived, they were deeply attached to their land,
thus were protesting their expulsion.  Adding to this, the ownership
of land was most important to our villagers.  The communist system of
collective farming was considered inferior and compared to &ldquo;absentee
ownership&rdquo;.  Thus no one was willing to put his neck in the
collective yoke.</FONT></FONT></P>

the call for voluntary &ldquo;resettlement&rdquo; was ignored, the

(pigs, Ukrainians).  Nearly all the Polish establishment, the army,
the police and the Polish villagers and towns people joined this
bloody activity with great joy and enthusiasm.  Thus began the orgies
of the cruel treatment of our population.  The lead was taken by the
Polish communist soldiers lead by their officers.  Chief among these
were: Captain Jan Wyzhganowki, &ldquo;poruchnyky&rdquo; Ceslaw
Kosakowski and Wladyslaw Kwiatkowski, captains Bernatowski and
Gurmowski in the Sianik and Krosno counties.  Captain Gzyra had a
