<H2 CLASS="western">From the Ellis Island records, I found this to be
the first destination of the <FONT COLOR="#993300">Kotlar/Kotlarz,
Wdowiak</FONT> and <FONT COLOR="#993300">Warcholyk</FONT> lines of
the family.  My grandmother, Anna Kotlarz, who arrived on March 30,
1910 aboard the ship Neckar from Bremen page, #186 of the manifest,
line #13, claimed as her destination the residence of her uncle, Jan
Kotlarz whose address was 713 Charlie [Charles} Street, Perth Amboy. 
I tried to search the 1910 and 1920 New Jersey census for this person
but currently the census is not indexed and after searching line by
line until I was nearly blind I decided not to continue.</H2>

never contacted the family afterwards.  Michael  never married. He
was a career army/air force member, joining in about 1920.  Emlyn
worked in Detroit, Michigan. His death certificate noted that he had
married Florence <FONT COLOR="#cc0000">Skinner</FONT> there.  I have

in Swiatkowa W.  Wasyl was from the nearby village of Desznica.  
After they immigrated, about 1901, they established themselves in
Salem, MA.  Wasyl opened a grocery store in the &ldquo;Polish&rdquo;
section of town on the corner of Hardy and Derby Streets.  There is a
candy store located on the spot now.  They soon purchased a house on
Hardy Street, which a member of their family still owns. Wasyl died
an early death in 1917 at age 45.  Julianna was left with 6 small
children, Michael, Paul, Nicholas, Mary, Anna and Amelia. All grew up
in Salem and descendants still live in the area.  Their first child,
Daria, was born in Swiatkowa prior to her parents&rsquo; emigration.

Neither does anyone know where Catherine is buried.  She brought her
three children to the USA, one at a time between 1893 and 1897.  Her

1920 census. The surname Siry became Sirak for whatever reason, but
still the family and his children were known in the community as the
Martin family.  In 1922 the family bought property and built a house
in the Buttonwood section of Wilkes Barre.  Mike and wife Anna

<H2 CLASS="western">Mary Siry was my grandfather Michael&rsquo;s
older sister.  She immigrated in 1893 at the age of 9 years.  By 1900

married Andrew <FONT COLOR="#993300">Mazur</FONT> and lived in

Martin Mazur died between 1920-1923 and Andrew, her husband, married

Two brothers married two sisters.  John&rsquo;s marriage produced two
living children, Margaret b. 1915 and Elizabeth, b.1917.
Unfortunately, John was not healthy and succumbed to tuberculosis
about 1923.  His wife Eva married two more times. Her second husband

no future for his children in Dudynce, their father sent Antony, Anna
