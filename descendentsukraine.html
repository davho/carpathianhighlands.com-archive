family from Swiatkowa Wielka were removed from their ancestral
village, beginning in 1945, and were transported 600 miles to the
Kharkiv area of the  USSR, a 6 week journey in a box car along with
their two cows .  My only current contact is with the descendants of
Demetri Dran, my grandfather&rsquo;s brother.  Family stories tell of
their transport.  Somehow they were able to get everyone in that
branch of the family out of Kharkiv and eventually to the town of
Kalush, which is now in Ukraine.  A few years ago I found a
20-year-old address on a Christmas card that I had saved.  I sent a
blind letter and to my surprise received a reply.  The family is
still living there. I am now in regular contact with that branch of
the family. Surnames associated with this family are Cyrkot, Dran,
Maihzych, Mishchenko, Jankovych, Tyrpak, Naglovskiy,Oliynik Wladyka.

learned that in 1945 troops came to Swiatkowa to transport  the
village population. The family and any possessions they could carry
were loaded onto trains and off to the USSR they went. At their
destination, Volodymyr&rsquo;s father, Nicholas Dran bought a horse
and cart and drove the family back to the border in an attempt to
return.  The Polish border was tightly secured.  The family proceeded
to Kalush, Ukraine, where there were a few abandoned homes vacated by
Polish citizens returning to Poland.</B></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

born to  Wasyl Nestor and Julianna Dran Nestor but was raised by her
uncle in Swiatkowa W., Demetri Dran.  Her descendants live in Kalush,
Ukraine.</P>

elderly 2<SUP>nd</SUP> cousins and their families.  It was  a very
emotional meeting after so many years.</P>
