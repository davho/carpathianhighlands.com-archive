May 2002 my husband and I visited my three ancestral villages of
Swiatkowa Wielka and Dudynce that are now in southern Poland and also
the village of Hrabovcik, which is located in eastern Slovakia.  We
flew to Vienna and toured that city for a few days, then met some
friends who once lived near us in the states.  With them we took day
trips in the Czech Republic, where they now live.  They put us on a
train to Krakow, which was a lovely experience that allowed us to
talk to four historical conservators who were on their way to a
conference in Krakow.  We met our guides, Halina and Andre Malaccy,
who are Lemko guides.  They are schoolteachers by profession.  They
provided us with a memorable experience as we traveled to each
village, talking to the people and visiting the churches.  I had done
a lot of family research before the trip and I thought I was
prepared, but when I got back home I realized there were many other
questions that I should have asked. However, I was smart enough to
take along a tape recorder and used it to record my verbal travel
diary.  It allowed me to record the sound of the cuckoo bird in the
Carpathian forest as well the Muppets speaking Polish on TV.  There
was plenty of fun stuff and some typical tourist stuff.  We ended up
back in Krakow, toured that wonderful old city with castles and
churches.  Took day trips to the Salt Mines and Auschwitz and flew
from Krakow to the USA via London, my most favorite city in the whole
world.  Everyone should have the opportunity to walk on the soil of
his or her ancestors. </SPAN>

I was&nbsp;born in Buckley, Washington, a small&nbsp;logging and
mining community.&nbsp; Both sides of my family&nbsp;worked in the
coal mines.&nbsp; My maternal grandparents came from Scotland and
England, and their ancestors were accounted for.&nbsp; But my
paternal grandparents, Stephan and Lena Kates, were secretive about
their past.&nbsp; They would only say they came from Austria.&nbsp;
No further discussion.&nbsp; One time my sister attempted to question
Grandma Kates about whether she had any brothers or sisters, and she
began crying.&nbsp; Never again would anyone ask a question to make
Grandma cry.</P>

&nbsp;My inquisitive mind could not let it go, but I did not know how
to begin finding out the secrets from the past.&nbsp; It was only in
mid-life,&nbsp;after I had begun working in a civil servant position,
did I realize that there were many public records available to people
willing to ask.&nbsp; Most of my queries were futile.&nbsp; But on
one visit to my Aunt Mary, she told me that she was born in Mayfield,
Pennsylvania.&nbsp; I contacted a genealogical society in
Pennsylvania and found a man who agreed to&nbsp;visit the Orthodox
Church in Mayfield and request baptismal records.&nbsp; With that
first record, our ancestors&nbsp;began to reveal themselves.&nbsp; I
now had my great grandparents' names and their place of origin<FONT SIZE=2>.</FONT></P>

&nbsp;Throughout the next ten years, I stumbled through numerous
websites and public records to no avail, satisfying myself with
finding all my cousins, aunts and uncles from&nbsp;our fractured
family who are still living.</P>

&nbsp;One day in June 2002, I punched the word &quot;Swiatkowa&quot;
into the internet yet one more time, and the first hit was a posting
by Gloria Elston announcing she had just returned from Swiatkowa and
had photos.&nbsp; I nearly fainted.&nbsp; I wasn't even sure
Swiatkowa still existed as anything more than a name on a map.&nbsp;
I immediately contacted her, and throughout the next few months
figured out a course of action.&nbsp; After 58 years, I was ready to
go to Poland and see for myself!</P>

&nbsp;My husband and I spent a year planning.&nbsp; We decided to use
the Maleccys from Bobowa, guides recommended by the Elstons&nbsp;
<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A CLASS="western" HREF="mailto:lemko_tour@poczta.onet.pl">lemko_tour@poczta.onet.pl</A></U></FONT>.&nbsp;
We spent two weeks in Poland, centering our tour around southeastern
Poland, the Lemko villages.&nbsp;&nbsp;We were not interested in
making a tour of large cities, although we did spend two days in and
around&nbsp;Krakow.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.21in; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; border-top: none; border-bottom: none; border-left: 1.00pt solid #800000; border-right: none; padding-top: 0in; padding-bottom: 0in; padding-left: 0.06in; padding-right: 0in">
&nbsp;The Maleccys were wonderful guides&nbsp;who helped us find
records that otherwise&nbsp;would not have been made available to
American tourists.&nbsp; We spent two days in Prszemysl at the record
center, and the Mallecys pitched in and helped&nbsp;my husband and
I&nbsp;search records.&nbsp; Halina and Andrzej are both&nbsp;well
educated and&nbsp;were extremely helpful in our&nbsp;research.&nbsp;
In&nbsp;addition to pouring over records with us,&nbsp;they
were&nbsp;skilled and tactful ambassadors.</P>

&nbsp;Besides&nbsp;finding&nbsp;pertinent genealogical data of&nbsp;my
family, I also found two maps from&nbsp;1851 of the two villages from
which my grandparents came--Swiatkowa (both Mala and Weilka) and
Zydowskie.&nbsp; With those in hand, we returned to the villages a
second time and were able to find the exact site where my
grandfather's home once stood.&nbsp; The&nbsp;disturbed ground
surface where the foundation lay&nbsp;was apparent, and there&nbsp;were
still a few&nbsp;ancient&nbsp;apple trees standing in their orchard<FONT SIZE=2>.</FONT></P>

&nbsp;In Swiatkowa we found the general area where my grandmother's
house once stood, but could not&nbsp;figure out with precision the
exact site.&nbsp; But we were able to&nbsp;attend a vesper service in
St. Michael the Archangel's Church one evening.&nbsp;The service was
Roman Catholic and in Polish, but the familiar cadence, verse after
verse,&nbsp;with each petition&nbsp;of the prayers transcended
language<FONT SIZE=2>.</FONT></P>

&nbsp;From this once-in-a-lifetime journey, I was able to&nbsp;make a
firm&nbsp;connection with my past.&nbsp; The family traditions and
customs I experienced as a child in my grandparents' home&nbsp;now
make sense.&nbsp; It is with thanksgiving and&nbsp;a sense of deep
pride that I am now able to say, &quot;I am Lemko.&quot;

in Poland, August, 2003, A Personal Experience </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">Two
very important events occurred for me during this most exciting and
memorable trip: visiting the villages of my grandparents and
researching the Przemysl Archives.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;Having
previously visited Lemkovyna in 1997, when the opportunity to find
the villages of Swierzowa and Swiatkowa was not available, and nor
were we able to enter the archives, I just knew this tour was going
to be successful for me.  And indeed it was!  More so than I could
ever imagine!</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;Our
Lemko hosts, Halina and Andrej Malecki, were not only gracious, but
went out of their way to see that everyone on the tour would find
their family village, if possible.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">During
a conversation with Halina about my two villages, she informed me
that her best friend from high school&rsquo;s mother lived in the
last remaining house in Swierzowa, a small village which was totally
destroyed during Akcja Visla in 1947 and when the Lemkos were sent to
northern cities in Poland. Several of my cousins were victims of this
movement.  Halina said that we would be served freshly caught trout
for lunch at a tavern owned by this woman&rsquo;s son, Jan Gracon. 
This was a name I knew!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in"><FONT COLOR="#000000">
Our visit was a treasure of coincidences.  Anna Gracon&rsquo;s
deceased husband is related to a woman who has lived across the
street from my mother in Monessen, PA for over 55 years. Anna
remembered some of my family names and said they had all moved in
1947. She was charming and sweet and our interview was delightful. 
Later, Marilyn Barbetta and I talked with her daughter-in-law,
Gracyna, and Marilyn discovered that Gracyna is related to her by
marriage. Gracyna was filled with tears when she learned this.  What
a joy for us to have met these simple people living a rather remote
area of Poland!  After lunch, Halina and Andrej drove a mile away to
the village cemetery. Alas, I was able to find only one gravesite
with the Dziadyk name.  Nevertheless, this day will be forever etched
in my memory.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;Twenty-one
of our group spent one full day archiving in Przemysl, affording us
the pleasure of actually touching the records of our forefather&rsquo;s
births, deaths and marriages.  The staff was extremely helpful in
interpreting the Poland letters and language.  Tables with lamps were
set up for us and the hours flew by quickly as we researched and
recorded our findings.  Lucky for me, I didn&rsquo;t have to share my
precious box with anyone.  Unfortunately, I could not find my
mother&rsquo;s paternal grandparent&rsquo;s records.  Iwona
Dakieniewicz, our genealogist, suggested the records might be in
Skolysyn and offered to research that archive.  Two days later, I
received a 9-page fax from Iwona with my great grandparent&rsquo;s
marriage records and information about other family members.  My
visit to Poland was now complete!  I couldn&rsquo;t ask for anything
more!</FONT></P>

cousin, Volodymyr, who lives in Ukraine.  He invited me to meet him
at the Lemko Vatra in Zdynia, Poland. Considering that we are both
are up there in age and that I do not at this time feel comfortable 
traveling to Ukraine, and that he had no chance to travel to the US,
I decided that it was something I should do. Fortunately my daughter
agreed to go with me so I began planning the trip. The Vatra
(festival) was held on July 23,24 and 25</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><SUP>th</SUP></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
in Zdynia, Poland, in the heart of the former Lemko area.  Not the
most comfortable season to be in Poland, but in traveling one must be
flexible.  Since my last visit in 2002, I have discovered cousins in
Slovakia and we had met during this interim, so it was the ideal time
to make this a &ldquo;people trip&rdquo;,  Cousins in Slovakia,
Cousin at the Vatra and a visit with our former guides on the 2002
trip,  Halina and Andreij of Lemko Tours.  I would throw in a stop in
Sanok so I could look at records in two repositories and also visit
Dudynce again.  With my daughter as a travel companion, it would be a
chance for me to pass on my ancestral heritage to the next
generation.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">I
made all of the reservations on the internet.  We flew in and out of
Krakow, Poland because there was a direct flight from Chicago and it
was less expensive than flying to Kosice, Slovakia.  I rented a car
online, made hotel reservations in Kosice, Sanok, Gorlice and Krakow.
 I emailed my Kosice cousins and wrote to Volodymyr to say we were
coming.  Our trip covered 12 days, mainly since we wanted to begin
the trip on a weekend (for convenience of the Kosice cousins) and
return home so my daughter could have time to get ready for her beach
trip with her family.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">Air
trip was uneventful and smooth, the overseas flight (LOT Air).  Our
rental car was waiting for us at the airport (VW Jetta).  We rented a
GPS which worked perfectly and got us to every hotel, town or address
that we wanted.  I had backup maps on hand just in case, but we never
needed them.  Roads were very good in both Slovakia and Poland.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">We
spent our first night and last night in Krakow.  It is a wonderful
city with a well preserved Old Town, a castle, great eating, concerts
and lots of things to see and do. Our first concern after checking
into our hotel was to purchase a cell phone for use in Europe.  I had
borrowed a Verizon International phone, but with rates at $2.89/
minute, I really didn&rsquo;t want to use it, unless it was an
emergency.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in"><FONT COLOR="#000000">On
the way to Kosice we stopped for a raft trip on the Dunejec River
that divides Poland and Slovakia.  We spent three days with our
cousins in Kosice, including one night in the 1947 homestead of the
family in </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>Hrabovcik</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">.
 Met the extended family there, all excited to meet us and very
gracious hosts.  We were serenaded by centuries old folk songs, all
we could think of to sing were &ldquo;Clementine&rdquo; and &ldquo;You
are My  Are My Sunshine&rdquo; .  How embarrassing!  Attended the
village church where my great grandmother was married and my
grandfather christened, walked the cemetery and fought off horrible
biting flies that seems to think that our rental car was their hive
and constantly buzzed around it, while parked.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Drove
to Sanok, stopping at the Dukla Pass Memorial on the way.  Spent
three nights in this town during which we visited the Civil Archive
in Bukowsko and the Sanok branch of the State Archive .  We hired a
translator through the hotel and traveled to </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>Dudynce</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
where we did a survey of the Greek Catholic Cemetery (data on this
website).  Toured some wooden churches  and other sights along the
way. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">On
to Gorlice  where we stayed in the only truly air-conditioned room in
the town (Room #6 in the Dark Pub B&amp;B)  That was our home base
from which we traveled south to Zdynia for three days to the Lemko
festival.  Lemko folk groups from many countries performed, in
remembrance of the homeland denied them  since 1947, in remembrance
of their culture which the Polish National Army at that time tried to
erase, in remembrance of their religion that Poland tried to
eradicate.  There was a lot of meaning being there at that festival
other than watching and listening to performances.</P>

did meet my 2</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><SUP>nd</SUP></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
cousin who had traveled to Zdynia from Kalush Ukraine.  He knew no
English, I knew no Ukrainian so we spoke some German with a lot of
hand waving and acting.  He traveled to his birthplace, </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>Swiatkowa
Wielka,</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> with us and showed us his
family&rsquo;s former homestead.  It was then that I realized how
difficult this was for him to return to the place where he was born
remembering that his family was forcibly driven out and relocated in
the USSR in 1945.  It was hard for him to see the cemetery where the
Lemko gravestones had been razed by the Polish Army, leaving only a
few large stone markers as a reminder.  We stood in the vacant field
and prayed for family souls buried beneath our feet but unmarked.  It
was hard for him to enter the village church which was formerly Greek
Catholic and now given over to the Roman Catholic Rite. We parted
back in Zdynia, with good memories of each other, exchanging old
family photos and ancestral information.  We will keep up our
