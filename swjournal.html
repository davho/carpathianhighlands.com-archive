 They traveled third class aboard the S.S. Dresden of the North
German Lloyd Line.  Sailing date was July 27, 1933. They landed in 
Germany and continued by train and then horse cart to their
destination, Swiatkowa Wielka.  At this time in history the village
was located in southern Poland.  (Click for <FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A CLASS="western" HREF="swjournal.html#World"><B>World

American talking picture with German translation.  After the movie I
had a drink of German beer and then went to my cabin and retired. 
While lying in my bed I could hear the ship&rsquo;s whistle blow at
intervals until finally I fell asleep.  Sweet dreams!</B></FONT></FONT></P>

sky was cloudy all day.  Sea was slightly rough with a cold wind
blowing.  People spent some time on deck this morning about 11
o&rsquo;clock.  We saw what was supposed to be a whale.  A stream of
water shot into the air at intervals about a thousand feet from our
ship.  All I saw was a fountain of water.  Never saw the back of the
whale.  In the evening at 4 0&rsquo;clock the deck steward took us to
the control cabin showing the various instruments used in guiding the
ship, such as the compasses, radio signal instrument that regulated
all the clocks on the ship.  At 8 o&rsquo;clock in the evening we had
a masquerade dance.  It was very colorful.  It was held for the Irish
who were to leave the following day at 1 o&rsquo;clock.  I have
photos of the dance.</B></FONT></FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western"><FONT COLOR="#993300"><FONT FACE="Verdana, sans-serif"><B>It
was a beautiful morning.  The sky was clear and the sun was hot. 
After breakfast, about 9 o&rsquo;clock, we sighted land.  It was
Ireland.  We were entering Galway Bay.  It took until 12:30, when our
ship dropped anchor about 2 miles from shore.  A ferry boat, or
tender as they called it, pulled up to the ship and took passengers
and baggage to shore. So, about 25 of our fellow passengers left us,
some which I had made friends with and sure was sorry to see them
leave.  About 2 o&rsquo;clock our ship turned around and headed for
the outlet of the bay.  On the way I noticed along the shore of the
bay were little villages and farm land in the distant hills,  also
mountains, but most of the coastline along Galway Bay was rocky and
all along the Irish coast as well.  In some places a mountain would
be cut off by the sea, a straight wall facing the sea.  Before
entering Galway, the sea was very calm.  As we were going south along
the Irish coast occasionally we would see a fishing boat.  The boat
left Galway at 1:45 P.M. The Irish coast is very rocky.  Here and
there a rocky island could be seen, and in the evening a light house
here and there warning of danger zones.  I&rsquo;ve been watching the
sea till 10 o&rsquo;clock, slight head winds, ship gaining speed
going with the current towards a beautiful moon.  What moonlight seen
on the water!  Well, we are heading for Cherbourg France.  That&rsquo;s
all for today.</B></FONT></FONT></P>

beautiful morning, a little wind blowing.  After breakfast I played a
few games of shuffle board on deck, later watched the sea, the
passing steamers, fishing and sail boats.  About noon we sighted the
English coast.  At one point there extended out what they called
Bishops Rock.  After passing it we went into open sea, no land until
10:30 P.M.  In the evening we came into the Bay of Cherbourg.  A
pilot ship came out to meet us and our ship stopped at the entrance
to the bay.  A tender pulled up to our ship and tool the passengers
from our ship to the port.  At about 1:00 A.M. our ship continued her
course toward Bremen.  While we were in the Bay of Cherbourg all you
could see were the city lights in the distance, about two miles. 
There were more friends gone which I probably will never see again. 
We are now going through the English Channel.  Tomorrow some time we
will come to the spot where the channel is narrow, some 26 miles.  It
was a beautiful day.  Good night!</B></FONT></FONT></P>

was a a beautiful day.  Played a few games of shuffleboard on deck. 
In the morning around 10 o&rsquo;clock, we sighted an Italian navy
sail ship.  It was the first sail ship I&rsquo;ve seen during the
day.  I&rsquo;ve taken a few snap photos with my camera on the deck
of the ship.  I have also seen a few passing vessels around 10:00
A.M.  We headed into the North Sea.  It was very quiet.  It was so
quiet that it looked as though it were frozen very smooth.  At 9:30 I
attended the concert given by the ship&rsquo;s orchestra.  They
played German folk songs.  It was an enjoyable evening.  Before going
to bed we packed our suitcases.  And to rest.</B></FONT></FONT></P>

early, dressed and went on deck.  It was a nice morning.  About 6
o&rsquo;clock, the pilot ship pulled up to our ship.  The pilot came
on board.  The ship was heading to the bay.  Soon we saw the shore on
both sides.  About 11:00 we landed at the dock at Bremerhaven.  Close
by was the ship Columbus and the Bremen.  The latter was sure a
beautiful ship.  After landing, our baggage was inspected in the
station.  We then went by train to Bremen.  Such train cars!  Not
like the American rail cars &ndash; no comfort and tiresome riding,
hard seats.  Eight passengers in a compartment.  American boxcars are
much better.  We arrived in Bremen at 11:45 A.M. and received
railroad tickets at German Lloyd Agency a little way from the
station, also a lunch box.  Leaving Bremen at 3:20 P.M. on to Berlin,
I rode standing up for 5 hours.</B></FONT></FONT></P>

in front of the station for curiosity&rsquo;s sake.  We left Berlin
at 11:20 P.M.</B></FONT></FONT></P>

in the couch upright.  It was very tiresome.  The scenery was
beautiful going through Germany.  Land was level, all farm land on
both sides of the train, mostly wheat fields in harvest dress.  The
peasant women and children were out in the fields cutting and
bringing in the harvest, some packing it up into stacks.  I saw
mostly grain fields.  Germany is sure noted for grain.  Passing town
after town we came to the boundary line of Germany and Poland.  Our
baggage was inspected by Polish officers.  They were kind of
sarcastic.  We changed trains in Tarnow.  We arrived at Tarnow at
1:00 P.M., rested in the station till 4:30 P.M., bought a ticket to
Yaslo.   After boarding the train to Yaslo, I discovered my
traveler&rsquo;s checks were missing, also father&rsquo;s checks were
missing.  We must have been pick pocketed while pushing through the
narrow passages in the coaches, or box cars is what I call them,
going from Tarnow to Yaslo.  It was getting mountainous.  One could
see homes here and there in the hills.  Saw children in the fields,
also women, all bare footed, working.  Very unusual scenes and very
interesting roofs of homes, covered with straw.  Although they looked
to be poor people, ragged and dirty.  They blended into the rest of
the beautiful valleys and mountains.  You could see beautiful young
girls, some holding a baby in her arms.  Sure get married early, I
judge.  We arrived at Yaslo in the evening at 7:30 P.M.  We went to
the waiting room and met Uncle Metro, who had waited two days for us.
 I went to the police station to notify them about our checks.  They
said they would gladly attend to our case and notify the bank of
Tarnow.  From the station Uncle took us to spend the night with a
friend of his a little way from Yaslo, which we did.  Father slept on
the floor on straw.  I and Uncle slept on benches.</B></FONT></FONT></P>

days waiting for us, so we hopped into the cart and away to his
place, passing many villages and little towns.  We stopped off in a
little town for lunch and I sent a telegram to the American Express

higher, beautiful pastures, spruce forests with tall trees as I have
never seen before.  Higher and higher we were going, and more you
could see of the beautiful country.  Mountain peaks were cultivated,
planted mostly with golden grain blending into the green forests here
and there.  Some of the scenes reminded me of a blanket made of
strips of remnants, golden, green and yellow, blending into a blue
sky.  Something I shall never forget.  People along the way in the
fields singing, although poor but happy.</B></FONT></FONT></P>

one night during our stay in Lvov.  The city of Lvov reminds me of an
American city with street cars, buses, automobiles, streets paved,
etc.  In the center of the city from in front of the theatre, off for
several blocks are planted beautiful flowers of all sorts, here and
there a park bench in the shade of trees.</B></FONT></FONT></P>

Uncle, father, Uncle&rsquo;s wife and I made a trip to Kaynecia, some
twelve miles from Swiatkowa.  It took us from 6 to 7:30 in the
evening to get there on a wagon.  It sure was a tiresome trip.  We
spent one night there.  The following day we bathed in the mineral
water at one of the bathhouses also drank some of the water and took
some home for other members of the family to taste.  The city of
Kaynicia </B></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana, sans-serif"><B>[Krynica?]</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#993300"><FONT FACE="Verdana, sans-serif"><B>
is a beautiful little city with beautiful little villas here and
there, also on the mountainsides.  The language spoken there is
mostly Polish. I forgot to mention that the same language is spoken
in Lvov.  We arrived home on September 29.  It was an interesting
trip home to my uncle&rsquo;s place going through valleys, over
mountain villages, crossing streams and over such roads with large
holes that would be very dangerous to travel at night.  I shall never
forget the Carpathian Mountains.  They are the most beautiful I have
ever seen.  On the way home we had spent the night at Father Myehailo
Fuk&rsquo;s place.  He sure was generous to us.</B></FONT></FONT></P>

the following morning, September 28, we started for home (Uncle&rsquo;s
place).  The day was beautiful.  On the way in one little town we
stopped off to attend a market for about two hours, then on we went
arriving home about 6 o&rsquo;clock.  We were all tired and so was
the horse, which pulled the wagon we rode in.  I&rsquo;ll say one
thing, my rear end was very sore from that trip.</B></FONT></FONT></P>

at 12 noon headed up the river and into the North Sea, which was
quite rough.  The ship swayed from side to side and made me a little
sick.  Made me vomit, but I felt good afterwards.  We arrived at
South Hampton England the following day October 6m at 9 o&rsquo;clock.
 There were many nice steamers in the harbor.  We pulled out of South
Hampton at 11:00 and arrived Cherbourg, France about 5 in the
evening.  The ship entered the gates of the harbor, stopped in the
center, a ferry boat took on and discharged passengers, also baggage
and mail.  The ship pulled out from Cherbourg at 6:30 and entered the
